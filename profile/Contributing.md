## Code of Conduct

Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We expect all participants to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before participating.

## Getting Started

1. **Find a project**: Browse our repositories and find a project that interests you.
2. **Check issues**: Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`, or `beginner-friendly`.
3. **Set up the development environment**: Follow the README in the specific project for setup instructions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. To report a bug:

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use the bug report template when creating a new issue
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the bug
4. Add screenshots or code samples if applicable
5. Describe expected vs. actual behavior

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome feature suggestions:

1. Search existing issues/suggestions first
2. Use the feature request template
3. Describe the feature in detail
4. Explain why this enhancement would be useful
5. Consider including mockups or examples

### Code Contributions

1. Comment on the issue you'd like to work on
2. Wait for assignment or approval from a maintainer
3. Follow our development workflow (below)

### Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fixing typos
- Clarifying explanations
- Adding examples
- Translating content
- Creating tutorials

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`
3. **Add upstream**: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/cncs-org/repository-name.git`
4. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
5. **Make changes**: Implement your feature or fix
6. **Test your changes**: Ensure all tests pass
7. **Commit with meaningful messages**: `git commit -m "Add feature X"` 
8. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
9. **Create a Pull Request**

## Pull Request Process

1. **Use the PR template** provided
2. **Link related issues** in the PR description
3. **CI checks**: Ensure all automated tests pass
4. **Code review**: Address feedback from maintainers
5. **Approval**: PRs require approval from at least one maintainer
6. **Merge**: A maintainer will merge approved PRs

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs after the first line

### Code Style

Each project may have its own style guide. Generally:

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Include comments where necessary
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation for changes
